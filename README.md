# console-twitter

Commands prefix your commands with:

"->" - to publish a message

"my messages" - to display messages entered by you

"follow <username>" to follow another user (You can use the example "follow Mahmut")

"wall" - to display messages of both followers and yourself

Currently you can only follow Mahmut. After you escape the session is closed and you start from the beginning.

If you have any suggestions on improving the code I would love to know one way or another (create issue or you can fork and make changes)
