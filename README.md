Commands prefix your commands with:

"->" - to publish a message
"my messages" - to display messages entered by you
"follow <username>" to follow another user (You can use the example "follow Mahmut")
"wall" - to display messages of both followers and yourself

Currently you can only follow Mahmut. After you escape the session is closed and you start from the beginning.
